In python, we have a simplicity to use any variable without it's type explicitly mentioning, which is 
`dynamic typing`.

But it creates a lot of problems where the root ones - 
    `data validation` - here difficult to catch the erros during debugging and testing phase


To overcome these issue, python introduced the dataclass and type hinting..
But we have a more full-fledged solution of data modeling in "`Pydantic`" with `data validation` & `data serialization`
